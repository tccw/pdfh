## The Name
While writing and picking a name for this tool, I discovered both [QPDF](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf) and [PDFtk ("tool kit") Server](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/), both of which offer much more than this project. I decided that this project is definitely not a tool kit, but maybe it's a single tool: just a hammer. It's not always the perfect tool for the job, but if you only need something simple then a hammer might do.
